# Seafile
## Deploy


#### For Third-party Packagers


If you want to package seafile yourself, (e.g. for your favorite Linux distribution), you should always use the correspondent tags:

* When we release a new version of seafile client, say 2.0.1, we will add tags '''v2.0.1''' to libsearpc, ccnet, seafile and seafile-client.
* Likewise, when we release a new version of seafile server, say 2.0.1, we will add tags '''v2.0.1-server''' to libsearpc, ccnet, seafile and seahub.

'''Note''':  In the rest of this page, the version numbers of each project has nothing to do with the tag name.
