# Seafile

## Deploying Seafile

Here we describe how to deploy Seafile from prebuild binary packages.

If you want to package seafile yourself, (e.g. for your favorite Linux distribution), you should always use the correspondent tags:

* When we release a new version of seafile client, say 3.0.1, we will add tags `v3.0.1` to ccnet, seafile and seafile-client.
* Likewise, when we release a new version of seafile server, say 3.0.1, we will add tags `v3.0.1-server` to ccnet, seafile and seahub.
* For libsearpc, we always use tag `v3.0-latest`.

**Note**: The version numbers of each project has nothing to do with the tag name.
