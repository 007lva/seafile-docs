# Sending Email Notifications on Seahub

## Options email sending

Please add the following lines to seahub_settings.py to enable Email sending.

<pre>
EMAIL_USE_TLS = False
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.domain.com'        # smpt server
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'username@domain.com'    # username and domain
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'    # password
EMAIL_PORT = '25'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
SERVER_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
</pre>

If you are using Gmail as email server, use following lines:

<pre>
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'username@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
SERVER_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
</pre>

**Note**: If your Email service still can not work, you may checkout the log file <code>logs/seahub.log</code> to see what may cause the problem. For complete email notification list, please refer to [Email notification list](customize_email_notifications.md).

**Note2**: If you want to use the Email service without authentication leaf <code>EMAIL_HOST_USER</code> and <code>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD</code> **blank** (<code>''</code>). (But notice that the emails then will be sent without a <code>From:</code> address.)
