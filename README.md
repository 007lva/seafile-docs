#Seafile

Seafile is a next-generation open source cloud storage system with advanced
support for file syncing, privacy protection and teamwork.

Collections of files are called libraries, and each library can be synced
separately. A library can be encrypted with a user chosen password. This
password is not stored on the server, so even the server admin cannot view a
file's contents.

Seafile allows users to create groups with file syncing, wiki, and discussion to
enable easy collaboration around documents within a team.

## LICENSE
Seafile and its desktop and mobile clients are published under the GPLv3.

The Seafile server's web end, i.e. Seahub, is published under the Apache
License.
